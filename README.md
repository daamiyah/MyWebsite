# INTRO

Hi there! I'm Damiyah, a 10-year-old girl who loves coding, designing, and creating cool stuff. 

I'm in Year 6, and I'm super excited to share my journey of learning and building with you.

# ABOUT ME

I'm a curious and creative who loves solving problems and making things. Whether it's coding, designing, or cooking, I enjoy learning new things and turning my ideas into reality. I'm currently learning:

    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (to build websites like this one!)
    - Python (for coding cool apps and games)
    - Canva (to design awesome graphics and presentations)
    - Excel (to organize data and make smart calculations)

I also excel in my schoolwork and love challenges that push me to think outside the box. My dream is to 
become a software engineer and designer who creates tools that make life easier and more fun for everyone.
