        <p class="lead">
            I'm a creative thinker, a problem solver, and an avid learner, always exploring new
            trends and techniques in design. When I'm not pushing pixels, you can find me with a sketchbook, capturing 
            the world or lost in the pages of a good design book.

                <div>
                    I love cooking with my family, and I noticed that sometimes itâ€™s hard to decide what to cook or how to use 
                    the ingredients we > already have. I wanted to create an app that solves this problem and makes cooking a 
                    fun adventure for everyone.

                <div>While building CookSMART, Iâ€™m learning how to:</div>

                    <li>Design the apps interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>Organize data and recipes using Excel.</li>
