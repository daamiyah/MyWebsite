            Introduction
        </h1>
        <p class="lead">Hello! I'm  Damiyah, I am 10 years old app developer in Wallington, London. 
            With over 1 years of experience, I thrive at the intersection of digital design, UX/UI, and 
            brand identity. My passion lies in crafting seamless user experiences and visually compelling 
            designs that resonate with audiences and drive engagement.

            About Me
        </h1>
        <p class="lead">I'm a creative thinker, a problem solver, and an avid learner, always exploring new
            trends and techniques in design. When I'm not pushing pixels, you can find me with a sketchbook, capturing 
            the world or lost in the pages of a good design book.
        </p>
